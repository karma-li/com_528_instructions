      <h2>Please Read and Save These Important Safety Instructions</h2>
      <h2>Features - Operation</h2>
      <p>
        When using electrical appliances, basic safety precautions should always be followed to
        reduce the risk of fire, electric shock, and injury to persons, including the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Read all instructions before using the appliance.</li>
        <li>
          To avoid fire or shock hazard, plug the appliance directly into a 120V AC electrical
          outlet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep the cord out of heavy traffic areas. To avoid fire hazard, NEVER put the cord under
          rugs or near heat registers.
        </li>
        <li>Place your humidifier at least 4 inches (10 cm) away from the wall.</li>
        <li>Keep your humidifier away from children.</li>
        <li>Operate your humidifier only with water in the tank.</li>
        <li>Refill your humidifier after unplugging the unit from its electrical outlet.</li>
        <li>Use only cleaners and additives recommended by the manufacturer to clean your humidifier
        weekly.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Cord and Plug Installation Safety Instructions:</h3>
      <p>
        The length of cord used on this appliance was selected to reduce the hazards of becoming
        tangled in, or tripping over a longer cord. If a longer cord is necessary, an approved
        extension cord may be used. The electrical rating of the extension cord must be equal to or
        greater than the rating of the humidifier (refer to the rating information placed on the
        humidifier). Care must be taken to arrange the extension cord so that it will not drape over
        the countertop or tabletop where it can be pulled on by children or accidentally tripped
        over.
